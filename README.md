## Overview 
Hipstore is an online retail website that was designed and built to feature all of the latest trends in fashion that are stylish as much as they are hip. My team and I believed that “Boredom was for lazy people” which helped us to tell a story through an online retail website bringing content and commerce together. Like all of our projects, our goal from the start was to align ourselves with the hipster culture and identify different opportunities that would help us to better express those ideas.


## Role 
- category pages (categories are things like mens, womens, etc.) that display all of the products of that particular category. 
- individual product page that displays information about a product (including title, price, description, image(s)). when you click on a product in the category page, you should be taken to the individual product page
-  created data stored in a 'data.js' file --> to help the way a user search through our products and have those items display the results
- a 'cart' that saves items users want to buy, and a way for users to add specific products to their cart
